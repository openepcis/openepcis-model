# GS1 Web Vocabulary Object Model

This project provides the JAXB mapping and Java Object Model for the GS1 WebVoc. It was created using the [GS1 JSON-LD to XSD Converter](https://github.com/openepcis/gs1-jsonld-to-xsd-converter) tool, which generates XSD schemas from JSON-LD @context. The generated XSD files were subsequently used to produce JAXB model bindings.
